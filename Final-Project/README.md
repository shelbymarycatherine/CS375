Project overview
 - My project proposal is a galaxy visualization project in WebGL, inspired by Dish channel 287. I intend to create a vortex of stars in the midst of space (a virtual version).

Project Schedule
 - Week 1: Look for inspiration, make sketches, brainstorm approaches to visualizing vortex.
 - Week 2: Develop code to render stars and galaxy. If time, find calculations to give the right vortex-type of look (I don't want just a rotation). 
 - Week 3: (If still necessary) vortex calculations. Make some color somewhere for colors in galaxies.

Technical requirements
 - I am going to be using WebGL.
