My favorite website I found of WebGL samples was https://webglsamples.org/ . This was my favorite because I think the animations are very abstract and beautiful, and something I would like to use as a guide to create digital art. My favorite overall website, however, was one that Dave provided: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MfjyWK . This was my favorite because not only are the animations very neat looking, but there is code with computations to go along with it to guide developers into how to make such an animation.
